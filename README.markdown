This is a web based app for managing a darts team (and may one day be expanded to deal with other sports teams).

The main goals are to be able to track your team members, and other teams players, record their scores, perform analysis on their performances, and use the data to formulate training strategies and match strategies based on the opposing teams past performances.

It should also act as an organisational tool, allowing team captains to contact their players, track their availability for games etc.

This is one of my first RoR projects, and I'm using it as a practice project to hone my skills.

In the minuscule chance that you're looking at this and really want to fork the project and make it better, please be my guest.
